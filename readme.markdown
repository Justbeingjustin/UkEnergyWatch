UK Energy Watch
===============

[UK Energy Watch][1] is an attempt to:

1. Monitor UK national energy use and generation in (near) real-time.
2. Track UK government targets on CO2 generation.
3. Provide an information source about climate change, and show the significance of energy generation/use in climate change.

It currently shows eletricity generation by generation type and power station *(not all power stations currently supported)*, and gas imports. CO2 generation is calculated approximately for eletricity generation.

*Source code will be uploaded soon...*

*Work-in-progress, lots more to do...*
