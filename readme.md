UK Energy Watch
===============

[UK Energy Watch](http://www.ukenergywatch.org/) is an attempt to make information about UK energy use more accessible.

A new version of this website is under development, and the code will be open-sourced here.

Components now available here are:

1. Electricity fuel-type data importer: Imports 5-minute generation by fuel type data from Elexon into local file-based storage. An Elexon account is required to use this.

2. A basic web page, showing the latest generation by fuel-type data.

*Work-in-progress, lots more to do...*
