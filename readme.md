UK Energy Watch
===============

[UK Energy Watch][1] is an attempt to make information about UK energy use more accessible.

A new version of this website is under development, and the code will be open-sourced here as it is ready.

Components now available here are:

1. Electricity data importer: Imports half-hourly near real-time data from Elexon into a local database. Please note that an Elexon account is required to use this.

*Work-in-progress, lots more to do...*
