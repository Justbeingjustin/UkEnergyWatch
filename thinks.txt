Want to show:

Raw:
Generation unit per half-hour
Fuel-type per half-hour

Aggregates:
Per generation-unit - location
Per power-station - location
County? - location

Per fuel-type - fuel-type
Green/dirty? - fuel-type


All aggregates split by time:
Half-hour
Hour
Day
Week
Month
Quater
Year
+ arbitrary

average + peak power aggregates

Each data item has allAggregateIds = aggregateIds with colon separaters
E.g. "genunit=drax-1:duration=1800" => aggregated by generation-unit & 30-minutes
E.g. "powerstation=drax:duration=3600" => aggregated by power-station & 60 minutes

Query for per-hour power-stations:
select * from data where agg="powerstation:d3600" and when between(...)
union
select * from data where agg="powerstation:d1800" and when between(<start-fragment>) or when between(<end-fragment>)

Before the above, a query will be needed to find the max(when) of each used aggregate
